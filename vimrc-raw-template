"  Hello, vim world.
"  -----------------
"
"  This is your new, personal ~/.vim/vimrc file. It's a place
"  where you can put your own vim initialization settings.
"
"  For example, you can create commands and map keys like this:
"
"     command! Build set makeprg=plink\ *.mk | make | copen
"     nmap <F5> :Build<CR>
"
"   This means "When I press F5, I want you to run 'plink *.mk' to build my
"   program, and then open the errors in the quickfix window."
"
"  Vimsane defines many initialization settings of its own.  Those are
"  applied first, and then your vimrc is loaded.  So you get the last word
"  on any setting.  If you don't like something that Vimsane does, you can 
"  undo it below, or add your own favorites.
"
"  You're encouraged to commit this periodically to the local git repository 
"  for safe-keeping and sharing. (Vimsane automatically sets up a vimsane-core
"  repository for you in your personal bbgithub account.)
